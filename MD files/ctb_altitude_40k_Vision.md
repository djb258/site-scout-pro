# 40k Vision - Storage Site Scouting Mission

## High-Level Mission

Evaluate rural storage site candidates across **West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia** using a repeatable, doctrine-driven system that systematically eliminates poor candidates and identifies high-potential sites.

## Core Doctrine

**Population Growth → Demand → Saturation → Parcel Viability → Financial Score**

This sequential pipeline ensures only viable candidates proceed through the evaluation process.

## Strategic Objectives

1. **Systematic Elimination**: Remove non-viable candidates early in the process
2. **Data-Driven Decisions**: Base all scoring on quantifiable metrics
3. **Repeatable Process**: Same evaluation criteria applied consistently
4. **Scalable Architecture**: Handle hundreds of candidates efficiently
5. **Audit Trail**: Complete process logging for transparency

## Target Markets

- **West Virginia**: Rural markets with growth potential
- **Pennsylvania**: Established markets with saturation analysis
- **Maryland**: High-density areas with premium pricing
- **Virginia**: Mixed urban/rural opportunities

## Success Metrics

- **Elimination Rate**: Percentage of candidates filtered out at each stage
- **Time to Decision**: Average processing time per candidate
- **Score Distribution**: Range and distribution of final scores
- **Financial Viability**: Percentage of candidates meeting financial thresholds

## Vision Statement

Create an automated, repeatable system that transforms raw candidate data into actionable investment decisions through systematic elimination and quantitative scoring.
